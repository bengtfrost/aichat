# aichat

> âš¡ A Rust-native fork of [sigoden/aichat](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat), replacing the `onig_sys` C dependency with pure-Rust `fancy-regex` for safety, portability, and simplicity.

## âœ¨ Why this fork?

The original `aichat` is a fantastic CLI for LLM interactions, but it relies on `syntect` + `onig_sys`, which pulls in the Oniguruma C library. This fork eliminates all native C dependencies by using:

* âœ… `fancy-regex` â€” A Rust-native regex engine
* âœ… Patch to `syntect` to replace `onig`
* âœ… Clean and portable build using only Rust crates

This makes it:

* ðŸ›¡ Safer (memory-safe, no FFI)
* ðŸ“¦ Easier to compile (no external C toolchains needed)
* ðŸ’» Ideal for Linux, macOS, and WASM targets

## ðŸ›  Building & Development

To contribute, you need:

* Rust toolchain (>= 1.70)
* `cargo` CLI
* Optional: `gh` for GitHub releases

### Patch Setup

We patch `syntect` to remove the `onig` dependency:

```toml
[patch.crates-io]
syntect = { path = "vendor/syntect" }
```

See [`docs/building.md`](docs/building.md) for full details.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

To verify everything works:

```sh
cargo check
cargo test
```

---

## ðŸ“¤ Release Process

1. Build release binary:

   ```sh
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. Upload to GitHub Releases:

   ```sh
   gh release create v0.29.1 target/release/aichat --title "aichat v0.29.1" --notes "Rust-native build with fancy-regex"
   ```
